# LinearRegression_Scratch

Implementing the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch, initially thought of using the ordinary least squares for calculating the loss function , but we were using a big dataset that had approx 50k rows so that made it very hard as most of our variables were overflowing so i had to take the mean squared error, we used the stochastic gradient descent to find out the optimal values for the weights and biases of our linear reg model, currently our accuracy(R^2 score) is not great around 0.08 but we'll try to improve our model in the future
